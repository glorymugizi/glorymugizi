 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web development student currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and frameworks such as React, Ruby on Rails, and NodeJs, as well as version control systems such as Git and GitHub.
I enjoy web development because it is an ongoing learning experience for me.

If you are interested in learning, collaborating, or hiring, please contact me at:
